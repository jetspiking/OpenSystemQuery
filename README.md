# Open System Query
Inspect your (Windows) system and view specifications and sensor data.

# Description
Open System Query is a program which utilizes the Windows Management Instrumentation to retrieve system information.  

# Usage
Download and launch the executable "OpenSystemQuery.exe". The program is portable.

[Releases](https://github.com/jetspiking/OpenSystemQuery/releases)

# Requirements
- Windows

# Information
Currently OSQ is only provided as a concept version. The application is still being developed. Currently design patterns are scarcily implemented because I wanted to publish this concept as soon as possible. The user interface and corresponding code quality is currently not up to standards and will be improved in the future.

The application can be used as a reference on how to use the Windows Management Instrumentation for different purposes.

# Contributing
